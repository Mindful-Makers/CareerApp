## My Contributions

During this project iteration, I focused on implementing GUI components and the supporting backend classes for the CareerApp project (see PR \#25). My workflow began with writing user stories and then developing JUnit tests to outline functional requirements. After solidifying the tests, I implemented the necessary core classes—including Company, CompanyService, and the WebServer—to make the graphical interface possible. Additionally, I contributed to the development of the application’s launcher class.

## Team Dynamics

Our team demonstrated perseverance and a positive attitude throughout the project. Everyone was approachable, respectful, and willing to help when questions arose, fostering a supportive atmosphere. However, communication outside of class meetings was a challenge; we often did not update each other as work was completed, which made it difficult to track ongoing progress. More frequent pushes to the branch and status check-ins would help us maintain real-time awareness of individual contributions and facilitate smoother collaboration.

## How We Could Improve

- Increase communication outside of designated meetings.
- Share in-progress work to branches instead of waiting until tasks are finished.
- Consider establishing quick daily check-ins or asynchronous updates on our progress.


## Feedback for Teammates

### Sayo

- **Appreciated:** You consistently reached out to clarify tasks and ensure that everyone was aligned on what needed to be done.
- **Suggestion:** Consider extending these communication efforts to the entire group, so all team members benefit from shared understanding and alignment.


### Jaiden

- **Appreciated:** I valued your teamwork approach; you were willing to ask questions, seek clarification, and co-problem-solve. You also shared helpful resources when we encountered blockers.
- **Suggestion:** Try to engage with the group more frequently outside our regular meetings to help distribute knowledge and maintain group cohesion.


### Elaine

- **Appreciated:** You demonstrated strong leadership by keeping the project moving forward, especially during times when whole team attendance was inconsistent. Your focus helped keep us on task.
- **Suggestion:** During in-person sessions, try to involve the entire group in updates and discussions—this can keep everyone informed and foster greater participation.


### Giorgina

- **Appreciated:** Your regular updates, both in and out of class, were invaluable. You helped keep everyone oriented toward the project’s next objectives and ensured clarity on our collective direction.
- **Suggestion:** I think there were like two occasions when your absence in person was unexpected though this was only a very minor issue.


## Technical and Soft Skills

Over this cycle, I strengthened my agile development skills, particularly in translating user stories into tests and corresponding implementations. Coordinating JUnit testing with class creation enhanced my understanding of test-driven development. Team-wise, clear and empathetic communication remains a crucial area for continual improvement.

## Lessons Learned

- Importance of frequent, open communication in agile teams.
- Test-driven development helps clarify requirements early and simplifies subsequent implementation.
- Leadership can take many forms, from coordinating tasks to supporting teammates’ questions.


## What I’m Most Proud Of

Committing to a process that prioritized testing, and ensuring foundational classes were robust and useful for the GUI.

## What I Would Do Differently

If starting over, I would encourage daily updates (even if brief) and create more visibility into in-progress work via Git branch activity and comments.
